# 🌐 TMKM Website Redesign 

The old TMKM website *worked*, but it didn’t *speak*.  
It felt like a dusty notebook—full of information, yet lifeless, lacking color, emotion, and the vibrant spirit of our campus.

As a student of TMKM, this always bothered me.  
Our institution is creative, dynamic, and full of achievements—so why should its digital face feel silent and outdated?

One quiet afternoon on campus, a thought struck me:

> **“If the website cannot tell TMKM’s story, then I will rebuild it so it finally can.”**

That moment sparked the beginning of this redesign journey.

## 🌟 The Journey Begins

I didn’t just want to update the website—I wanted to *transform* it.  
A website that feels:

- Modern  
- Clean  
- Warm  
- Alive  

Every section, every design element, every color reflects TMKM’s true essence.  
This redesign is more than code—**it’s storytelling through design.**

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Modern, minimalistic aesthetics**  
- **Story-driven user experience**  
- **Fully responsive design on all devices**  
- **Soft, cinematic animations for a polished feel**  
- **Clean, simple, and intuitive navigation**  

---

## 🚧 Current Progress

Only a few pages are completed so far.  
Gradually—*InshaAllah*—the full website will expand with new sections, fresh features, and enhanced design.

This is just the beginning.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **Vanilla JavaScript**  

Lightweight, fast, and completely hand-coded.

## 🏗️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the app locally:

```
### 2. Navigate to the project directory

```
